RecyclerViewAdapter
===================

> Base implementation of RecyclerViewAdapter that avoids the need to directly build your own adapter. 

## Overview

This project is mostly proof of concept and updates may include breaking changes.

## Code Style

This project is indented with 2 spaces and wraps after the 128th column for all code files. All files must end with a newline.

Why spaces? GitHub uses 8 spaces per tab in code previews which would cause code to show up differently.
  
Why 128 columns? Because at 10pt font, you can fit three files on a 2560x1440 monitor. Also, GitHub code viewer.
